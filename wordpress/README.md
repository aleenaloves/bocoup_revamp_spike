# Wordpress Score Card

## Disclaimer
There may be instances here that with my current experience I overlooked or did not handle the way the creators of the framework would reccommend. I do not know what I do not know, so if anyone is aware of better ways to handle anything that i've overlooked, let me know :)

## Quick Summary


## Introduction
This was just a general look into different themes in dev.bocoup.com compared to the existing bocoup.com baseline

## Statistics
- bocoup.com metrics: https://gtmetrix.com/reports/bocoup.com/27Kv1FfV/
- dev.bocoup.com metrics: https://gtmetrix.com/reports/dev.bocoup.com/loeNZLLl/ && https://gtmetrix.com/reports/dev.bocoup.com/qga4UBux/ - two different themes were shown to show that the metrics are dependant on the theme itself. 

### Network 
#### dev.bocoup.com Network (again this is theme dependant)
- Index: Finish 689 ms, DOMContentLoaded: 447 ms, Load 572 ms.  

#### bocoup.com Network
- Index: Finish 427 ms, DOMContentLoaded: 299 ms, Load 335 ms. 

#### dev.bocoup.com Size 
- Index: 24 requests, 495 kB transferred, 1.1 MB resources.

#### bocoup.com Size 
- Index: 25 requests, 460 kB transferred, 1.1 MB resources.

## The Creator Experience
The ease of creating pages in blocks and through an editor is an experience that's probably the best part of wordpress. Because of its open-source nature it also allows for customizations. The only cons come with keeping up with plugin maintenance and security issues. 

## The Audience Experience

### Accessibility
This would be dependant on the themes and custom coding chosen. 

### Site Updates
Have the potential to be in deprecated states based on plugin functionality, but the general page additions are easy.

### Other Notes
Although wordpress is customizeable, the interface is kinda bloaty and unintuitive
